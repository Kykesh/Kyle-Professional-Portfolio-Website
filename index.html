                <p>I am <strong>Kyle Huff</strong>, a dynamic and results-driven professional based in San Antonio, TX, with a rich background in business analysis, project management, and technical support. My expertise lies in seamlessly integrating technology solutions like Jira, Oracle, and Microsoft Office into business operations, enhancing efficiency and driving growth.

                <p>In my current role as an Oracle Consulting Sr. Analyst at Huron Consulting Group, I lead critical data validation and integration projects, leveraging my deep knowledge of SQL, API, and business intelligence to deliver exceptional results. My experience spans from managing complex Oracle Cloud implementations to leading data validation teams and developing comprehensive data strategies, ensuring accuracy and integrity in data handling.</p>

                <p>Previously, as a Business Analyst at PNC, I played a pivotal role in supporting the Paycheck Protection Program, ensuring compliance and minimizing fraud.

                <p>My military service with the US Air Force Reserve in the Logistic Readiness Squadron has instilled a strong sense of discipline, attention to detail, and the ability to manage decentralized inventory effectively. My internship at Goodman Manufacturing as a Credit Analyst further refined my analytical skills and dispute-resolution capabilities.</p>
