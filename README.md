## Description

This project presents a professional portfolio website aimed at showcasing a developer's work to potential employers. The site includes various sections detailing the developer's skills, work samples, and contact information. The focus of this portfolio is not just on the aesthetic presentation but also on functionality, accessibility, and responsiveness to cater to a wide range of devices and user preferences.


## User Story

As an employer looking to hire talent, I want to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples so that I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

## Acceptance Criteria

To ensure the portfolio website meets the needs of hiring managers, the following criteria have been established:

- **Developer Introduction**: Upon loading the portfolio, the user is presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.

- **Navigation**: Clicking a link in the navigation menu scrolls the user to the corresponding section of the portfolio.

- **Work Samples**: The "Work" section features titled images of the developer's applications. When clicked, these images take the user to the deployed application.

- **Featured Work**: The first application presented in the "Work" section has an image that is larger than the others, highlighting it as a featured piece.

- **Responsiveness**: The layout of the portfolio is fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes and devices to ensure a seamless experience across platforms.
